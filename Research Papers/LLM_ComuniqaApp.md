# Comuniqa : Exploring Large Language Models for Improving English Speaking Skills
##  System Architecture
### 1. User Speech Input
**Input Type:** Spoken English (audio waveform).

**Example:** User says:
*"Today I go to the market and buy some apples."*

###  2. Whisper (ASR)
**Model:** Whisper (encoder-decoder Transformer).

**Task:** Converts raw speech â†’ transcript with timestamps.

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "transcript": "Today I go to the market and buy some apples.",
  "timestamps": [
    {"word": "Today", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.4},
    {"word": "I", "start": 0.41, "end": 0.55},
    {"word": "go", "start": 0.56, "end": 0.75},
    {"word": "to", "start": 0.76, "end": 0.9},
    {"word": "the", "start": 0.91, "end": 1.0},
    {"word": "market", "start": 1.01, "end": 1.4},
    {"word": "and", "start": 1.41, "end": 1.6},
    {"word": "buy", "start": 1.61, "end": 1.9},
    {"word": "some", "start": 1.91, "end": 2.1},
    {"word": "apples.", "start": 2.11, "end": 2.5}
  ]
}
```

###  3. NLP/LLM Feedback Engine
**Models:** GPT-3.5

**Tasks:**
- Grammar correction
- Fluency scoring (based on IELTS/TOEFL rubrics)
- Vocabulary range analysis
- Coherence & cohesion check
- Pronunciation issues (using timestamps + phoneme alignment)

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "corrected_transcript": "Today I went to the market and bought some apples.",
  "scores": {
    "fluency": 7.5,
    "grammar": 7.0,
    "vocabulary": 6.5,
    "coherence": 7.0,
    "pronunciation": 7.5
  },
  "feedback": [
    {"error": "go", "suggestion": "went", "type": "grammar"},
    {"error": "buy", "suggestion": "bought", "type": "grammar"}
  ],
  "sentiment": "Neutral/Confident"
}
```

###  4. Feedback Module
**Functions:**
- Highlight grammar & vocabulary errors
- Visualize speech pacing (WPM), pitch, filler words, pauses
- Display IELTS-like scoring dashboard

**Example Visualization:**

**Annotated Transcript Example:**
*"Today I go  (went ) to the market and buy  (bought ) some apples."*


4. **Feedback Module:**
   Visualizes scores, highlights mistakes, and shows improved sentence

5. **App UI:**
   Displays feedback in an intuitive dashboard with progress tracking
